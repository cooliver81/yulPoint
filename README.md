Summary:
Facial recognition app, our implementation will include recognizing when someone
is fatigued and recommending a break or a coffee with a popup notification. 
We will use opencv to use the webcam.
Includes a database to track events and times.

Potential:
This app could be further developped to include other possibilities such as 
recommending a lunch break if the user is hungry. Another possibility could be 
a more longterm use, such as facial recognition to add information for a user.
This could potentially monitor long term changes in the user that could 
determine changes in mental health.
The program could also track when the user is most productive and most fatigued
and could recommend when to start work and when to leave for a flexible schedule.
For example someone who is more fatigued early in the day could potentially work 
night shifts. 

Division of work: 
Oliver: Created the Database and implemented opencv to determine drowziness
Dylan: Implemented the desktop notifications, created UML and attempted to create an executable
Helena: Implemented opencv to determine drowziness and attempted to add different events

Note:
We implemented a yawn counter from https://github.com/twinklejaswani/Yawn-Detection-using-OpenCV
and edited for the purpose of our project.
